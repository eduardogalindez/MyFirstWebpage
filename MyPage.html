	<h1>A little bit about me:</h1>
	<img src="me.jpg"/>
	<p>Hello, I am a recent graduate from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, with a bachelors in computer science. The reason im making this webpage is to practice my html and CSS skills(they are very rusty) and to learn various frameworks and make this page evolve. It will be a long process but I know I can do it!</p>
	<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/eduardogalindez"> my github.</a> It is a little empty right now but in time it will grow now that I have more time to work on making webpages and such.</p>
	<h2>I have various goals for my future, this example webpgae is going to help me to achieve those goals which are:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Get good at HTML</li>
		<li>Get good at CSS</li>
		<li>Learn Ruby on Rails</li>
		<li>Learn javascript</li>
		<li>Learn Ember</li>
	</ol>
